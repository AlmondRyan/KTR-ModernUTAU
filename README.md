Welcome to the source repository of KTR-ModernUTAU.

## Requirements

To build and run KTR-ModernUTAU from source, you will need the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: OpenJDK 23 or later.
- **JavaFX**: OpenJFX 23 or later.
> For Build Tool, I use Gradle instead of Maven. So you can see the `build.gradle` file means you can easily

- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle.

## Build

I don't want to say now. Don't worry, when I release the first version, I
will write this part.
